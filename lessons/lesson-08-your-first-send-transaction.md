# Your First Send Transaction

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/first-crypto-steps-media/images/lesson_08/first-crypto-steps_08_header.png)


**Core concept:** Sending crypto is like mailing a valuable package—prepare carefully, verify the address, and track delivery.

## Mailing a Package with Tracking

When you ship something valuable:
1. Pack it carefully
2. Write the address clearly
3. Double-check the address
4. Choose your shipping speed
5. Get tracking information
6. Confirm delivery

Sending crypto follows similar steps:
1. Prepare your wallet/exchange
2. Enter the recipient address
3. Verify everything carefully
4. Select your fee/speed
5. Get a transaction ID
6. Confirm receipt on blockchain

The difference: no undo. If you ship to the wrong address with FedEx, you might get it back. With blockchain, probably not.

## Before You Send: Preparation Checklist

Before initiating any transaction, verify:

**☐ Recipient address is correct**
- Copied from reliable source
- First and last characters match

**☐ Network matches**
- Both you and recipient using same network
- Recipient supports this network

**☐ Amount is correct**
- Double-check the number
- Confirm decimal places

**☐ You have enough for fees**
- Transaction amount + gas fees ≤ your balance
- Fee estimate looks reasonable

**☐ Test amount first (for large sends)**
- Send small amount
- Confirm receipt
- Then send the rest

## Step-by-Step: Sending from a Wallet

Using a self-custody wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.):

**Step 1: Open your wallet and select asset**
Navigate to the token you want to send.

**Step 2: Click "Send" or "Transfer"**
This opens the send interface.

**Step 3: Paste recipient address**
Always copy-paste, never type manually. Then verify first/last characters.

**Step 4: Enter amount**
Type the amount or use "Max" (careful—leaves nothing for fees).

**Step 5: Review transaction details**
Wallet shows: To address, amount, estimated fee.

**Step 6: Adjust gas if needed**
Some wallets let you choose slow/standard/fast.

**Step 7: Confirm**
Click confirm. May require biometric or password confirmation.

**Step 8: Get transaction ID**
Wallet shows a transaction hash/ID. Save this.

## Step-by-Step: Sending from an Exchange

Withdrawing from an exchange to external wallet:

**Step 1: Navigate to Withdraw**
Find the asset in your exchange wallet. Click "Withdraw."

**Step 2: Select network**
Choose the network carefully. Match what your receiving wallet supports.

**Step 3: Enter external address**
Paste the address from your receiving wallet.

**Step 4: Complete security checks**
Exchange may require: email code, SMS code, 2FA code.

**Step 5: Enter amount**
Exchange shows: Amount, network fee, you receive.

**Step 6: Review and confirm**
Triple-check address and network.

**Step 7: Wait for processing**
Exchanges sometimes have withdrawal delays.

**Step 8: Check your receiving wallet**
Once processed, funds appear in your wallet.

## Tracking Your Transaction

After sending, you can track progress:

**Get your transaction ID (hash):**
A long string like: `0x7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65d...`

**Use a block explorer:**
- Ethereum: etherscan.io
- Bitcoin: blockchain.com or mempool.space
- Solana: solscan.io

**Search your transaction:**
Paste the ID to see: status, confirmations, details.

**Status meanings:**
- **Pending:** Waiting to be included in a block
- **Confirmed:** Included in block, processing
- **Finalized:** Complete, irreversible

---

## Common First-Time Mistakes

**Wrong address:** Triple-check before confirming.

**Wrong network:** Verify both sides support the chosen network.

**Not enough for fees:** Leave buffer for gas.

**Impatience:** Network congestion causes delays. Don't panic.

**Sending all:** Using "max" might leave nothing for fees.

**Skipping test transaction:** For large amounts, always test first.
