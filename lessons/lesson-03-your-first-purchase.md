# Your First Purchase

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/first-crypto-steps-media/images/lesson_03/first-crypto-steps_03_header.png)


**Core concept:** Buying crypto is like buying foreign currency for a trip—you're exchanging money you have for money you want, with some fees along the way.

## Buying Foreign Currency for a Trip

Planning a trip abroad, you might:

1. Check the exchange rate (how many yen per dollar?)
2. Compare fees at different exchange services
3. Decide how much to exchange
4. Hand over your dollars
5. Receive your foreign currency
6. Get a receipt

Buying cryptocurrency follows the same basic flow:

1. Check the price (how much per Bitcoin?)
2. Compare exchange fees
3. Decide how much to buy
4. Pay with your chosen method
5. Receive crypto in your exchange account
6. See the transaction in your history

## Step-by-Step: Making Your First Purchase

Assuming you're using a centralized exchange and have completed verification:

### Step 1: Add a Payment Method
Connect your bank account, debit card, or credit card to the exchange.

**Bank transfer (ACH):** Lower fees, takes 1-5 days to process
**Debit card:** Instant, moderate fees (1-2%)
**Credit card:** Instant, highest fees (2-4%), may be treated as cash advance

### Step 2: Navigate to Buy
Most exchanges have a prominent "Buy" or "Buy/Sell" button. Click it.

### Step 3: Select What to Buy
Choose the cryptocurrency. For beginners, Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) are common starting points—widely recognized, available everywhere, with extensive track records.

### Step 4: Enter Amount
Either:
- How much fiat to spend: "I want to spend $100"
- How much crypto to buy: "I want 0.002 BTC"

The exchange shows you the conversion based on current price.

### Step 5: Review Fees and Total
Before confirming, you'll see:
- Amount of crypto you'll receive
- Exchange fee
- Total cost

Fees typically range from 0.5% to 4% depending on exchange and payment method.

### Step 6: Confirm Purchase
Double-check everything. Click confirm. Your purchase executes.

### Step 7: View Your Balance
Navigate to your wallet/portfolio. You should see your new crypto holdings.

## How Much Should You Buy?

The golden rule: **Only invest what you can afford to lose entirely.**

Cryptocurrency is volatile. Prices can drop 50% in weeks or months. You should be financially okay if that happens.

Good approach for beginners:
- Start small (even $10-50) just to learn the process
- Don't invest emergency fund money
- Don't invest money needed for upcoming bills
- Consider it like learning budget, not investment

You can always buy more once you understand how everything works.

## Understanding the Price You Get

When you buy, you might not get exactly the price you saw:

**Spread:** Difference between buy price and sell price. Exchanges make money here.

**Market movement:** Prices change constantly. The price might shift between viewing and purchasing.

**Slippage:** For large orders, you might move the market and get worse average price.

For small purchases, these differences are usually minor. But know they exist.

## What Happens After Purchase

Your crypto now sits in your exchange account. From here you can:

**Hold it:** Leave it on the exchange (convenient but less secure for large amounts)

**Withdraw it:** Move to your own wallet (more secure, you control the keys)

**Trade it:** Exchange for other cryptocurrencies

**Sell it:** Convert back to regular money

For your first purchase, simply holding on the exchange while you learn more is fine. As you grow comfortable and increase holdings, withdrawing to self-custody becomes more important.

---

## Common First Purchase Mistakes

**Buying more than you can afford:** Start small. Learn. Increase later.

**Rushing:** Take time to understand each step. No need to hurry.

**Ignoring fees:** Some payment methods cost much more than others.

**Panic selling immediately:** Prices fluctuate. Don't react to every movement.

**Buying random cryptocurrencies:** Start with established options. Research anything else extensively.
