# Moving Crypto Off an Exchange

**Core concept:** Moving crypto off an exchange is like moving valuables from a bank safe deposit box to your home safe—you're taking personal custody.

---

## Bank to Home Safe

Imagine you've stored jewelry at the bank's safe deposit box:
- Convenient—they handle security
- But you need to go to the bank during hours
- You trust they won't lose it or freeze access

Eventually, you might want it in your own home safe:
- You control access 24/7
- No one can freeze it
- You're responsible for your own security

Moving crypto off exchange follows similar logic: you're taking control but also taking responsibility.

## Why Move to Your Own Wallet

**Reasons to withdraw:**

- **True ownership:** You control the keys, you own the crypto
- **Exchange risk:** Exchanges can fail (FTX, Mt. Gox)
- **No account freezes:** No company can lock you out
- **Privacy:** Exchanges know your transactions; your wallet doesn't report to anyone
- **Long-term holding:** If you're not trading, why leave it with them?

**Reasons you might wait:**

- Learning and not confident in self-custody yet
- Active trading (need quick access)
- Very small amounts (withdrawal fees might not be worth it)

## Before You Withdraw: Checklist

**☐ Wallet is set up**
You have a functioning wallet with backed-up seed phrase.

**☐ You've verified the wallet works**
Maybe received a small test amount already.

**☐ You understand the network**
Know which network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) you're using.

**☐ You know withdrawal fees**
Exchanges charge for withdrawals—know the cost.

**☐ You won't need these funds urgently**
Once off exchange, selling requires sending back—time and fees.

## Step-by-Step: Withdrawing from an Exchange

**Step 1: Get your wallet address**
Open your wallet. Find "Receive" for the specific crypto. Copy the address.

**Step 2: Navigate to exchange withdrawal**
In exchange app/website: find your wallet/assets, select the crypto, click "Withdraw."

**Step 3: Select network**
Choose the network that matches your wallet. If your wallet is set to Ethereum mainnet, select Ethereum (ERC20).

**Step 4: Paste your wallet address**
Paste the address from Step 1. Verify first and last characters match.

**Step 5: Enter amount**
Enter how much to withdraw. Note the fee.

**Step 6: Complete security verification**
Exchange likely requires: email code, SMS code, authenticator code.

**Step 7: Wait for processing**
Some exchanges process instantly. Others have withdrawal delays (security hold, manual review).

**Step 8: Verify receipt**
Check your wallet. Check blockchain explorer with transaction ID.

## Test Transaction First

For significant amounts:

1. Withdraw a small amount first ($5-20 worth)
2. Verify it arrives in your wallet
3. Once confirmed, withdraw the rest

This costs extra in fees but ensures:
- Address is correct
- Network is correct
- Wallet is receiving properly

Peace of mind is worth a few extra dollars.

## After Withdrawal: What Changes

**On exchange:**
- You could sell instantly
- Support could help with issues
- 2FA and password protected

**In your wallet:**
- You sell by first sending back to exchange (or using DEX)
- No support if you make mistakes
- Only your seed phrase protects funds

The responsibility shift is significant. Make sure you're comfortable with it.

---

## Common Withdrawal Mistakes

**Wrong address:** Double-check before confirming.

**Wrong network:** Verify network matches wallet setup.

**Forgetting fees exist:** Exchange fee + network fee = total cost.

**Not having backup:** Before large withdrawal, verify seed phrase backup.

**Withdrawing everything at once:** Better to test first with small amount.

**Panic at delays:** Some exchanges hold withdrawals. This is often normal.
