# Lesson 11: Backing Up Your Wallet

**Core concept:** Backing up your wallet is like making copies of your house key—if you lose the original, you can still get in.

## Making Copies of Your House Key
![Inline Analogy](https://storage.googleapis.com/first-crypto-steps-media/images/lesson_11/first-crypto-steps_11_inline_analogy.png)


You probably have spare house keys:
- One in your wallet
- One hidden somewhere safe
- Maybe one with a trusted neighbor

If you lose your main key, you're not locked out forever. You have backups.

Your crypto seed phrase works the same way:
- Write it down when creating wallet
- Store the backup safely
- If phone breaks/gets stolen, use backup to restore

The difference: lose all copies of your house key, you can call a locksmith. Lose all copies of your seed phrase, no one can help.

## What You're Actually Backing Up

**The seed phrase is the backup.**

Your seed phrase (12 or 24 words) is the master key that generates all your private keys, which control all your addresses.

Back up the seed phrase = back up the entire wallet.

You don't need to backup:
- Transaction history (on blockchain forever)
- Individual private keys (generated from seed)
- The app itself (can reinstall)

You only need the seed phrase to fully restore everything.

## How to Create a Proper Backup

**Step 1: Get the words right**
Copy exactly, in exact order. One wrong word or wrong order = won't work.

**Step 2: Write on durable material**
- Paper: Works, but can burn, flood, fade
- Metal: Steel or titanium plates resist fire/flood
- Multiple copies recommended

**Step 3: Store securely**
- Home safe
- Bank safe deposit box
- With trusted family member
- Multiple locations for redundancy

**Step 4: Never store digitally**
No photos. No screenshots. No email. No cloud. No notes app. No password manager. Hackers look for these.

## The Disaster Scenarios

**If you have backup:**
- Phone stolen → Buy new phone, reinstall wallet, enter seed phrase, funds restored
- Computer crashes → Same process on new device
- House fire → Use backup from other location

**If you don't have backup:**
- Phone stolen → Funds gone forever
- App deleted accidentally → Funds gone forever
- Device dies → Funds gone forever

Stories of lost crypto worth millions exist because people didn't back up—or backed up digitally where hackers found it.

## Multiple Backups: The Right Way

One backup isn't always enough:

**Geographic distribution:**
Keep copies in different physical locations. House fire shouldn't destroy all backups.

**Different mediums:**
Paper backup + metal backup. If one fails (fire destroys paper, water damages metal), other survives.

**Consider splitting:**
Some people split seed phrase: words 1-6 in location A, words 7-12 in location B. Controversial—requires finding both, but also protects against single theft.

**Test your backups:**
Before significant funds, verify you can restore from backup. Try on a separate device.

---

## Common Backup Mistakes

**Digital storage:** Screenshots, cloud, email. Most common mistake. Hackers find these.

**Not double-checking:** One wrong word means failed restore.

**Single copy only:** One location = one disaster away from total loss.

**Telling people:** The more people who know, the more risk.

**Overly clever hiding:** If you die, can family find it? Have a plan.

**Forgetting to backup at all:** "I'll do it later" → device breaks → funds gone.

---

## Planning for Worst Case

Think about inheritance:
- If something happens to you, how do family access funds?
- Where are backup instructions?
- Who knows the backup locations?

Options include:
- Trusted family member knows location
- Instructions in a will
- Sealed envelope with lawyer
- Multi-signature setups

This isn't just paranoia—it's responsible planning.

## Key Takeaways

- **Seed phrase IS your backup**—nothing else needed to restore complete wallet
- **Write on durable materials**—metal plates survive fire/flood better than paper
- **Store in multiple secure locations**—one disaster shouldn't destroy all backups
- **Never store digitally**—hackers search for seed phrases in photos, cloud, email
- **Test your backup**—verify restore works before significant funds
- **Plan for inheritance**—make sure trusted people can access if needed
