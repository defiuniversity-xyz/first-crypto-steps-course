# Lesson 10: Setting Up Your Own Wallet

**Core concept:** Setting up a crypto wallet is like setting up a new mailbox—you're creating a destination for receiving funds that only you can access.

## Setting Up a New Mailbox
![Inline Analogy](https://storage.googleapis.com/first-crypto-steps-media/images/lesson_10/first-crypto-steps_10_inline_analogy.png)


When you move somewhere new:
1. Get a mailbox (physical infrastructure)
2. Get the address (where people send things)
3. Get the key (only you can access contents)
4. Make a spare key (in case you lose the original)

Setting up a crypto wallet follows similar steps:
1. Install wallet app (the infrastructure)
2. Get your address (where people send crypto)
3. Create your keys (automatically generated)
4. Backup your seed phrase (your spare key)

## Choosing Your First Wallet

For beginners, start with a reputable hot wallet:

**For Ethereum and EVM chains:**
- MetaMask (browser extension + mobile)
- Coinbase Wallet (mobile focused, not the exchange)
- Rainbow (mobile, user-friendly)

**For Solana:**
- Phantom (browser + mobile)
- Solflare

**For multiple chains:**
- Trust Wallet
- Exodus

Choose based on: what chains you'll use, whether you prefer mobile or browser, and reputation.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your Wallet

Using MetaMask as an example (process is similar for others):

**Step 1: Download from Official Source**
Go directly to metamask.io. Verify the URL. Download for your device (browser extension or mobile app).

⚠️ Warning: Fake MetaMask apps exist. Only download from official sources.

**Step 2: Create New Wallet**
Open the app. Select "Create new wallet" (not "Import" unless you have an existing seed phrase).

**Step 3: Create Password**
This password locks the app on your device. Make it strong. This is NOT your seed phrase—it's just local device security.

**Step 4: Secure Your Seed Phrase**
The wallet generates and displays your 12 or 24-word seed phrase.

THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL STEP:
- Write it down on paper
- Do not screenshot
- Do not store digitally
- Do not share with anyone
- Do not skip this step

**Step 5: Confirm Seed Phrase**
The app asks you to confirm the words in order. This verifies you wrote them down correctly.

**Step 6: Wallet Ready**
You now have a wallet with an address ready to receive crypto.

## Your First Wallet Address

After setup, find your address:

1. Open wallet
2. Look for "Receive" or click your account name
3. See your address (starts with 0x for Ethereum)
4. Copy or show QR code when needed

This address is safe to share—it's how people send you crypto.

## Critical Security Steps

**Seed phrase storage:**
- Write on paper (or metal plate for durability)
- Store in secure location (safe, safe deposit box)
- Consider multiple copies in different locations
- Never store digitally (no photos, no cloud, no notes app)

**Device security:**
- Keep device software updated
- Don't install sketchy apps on the same device
- Use strong passcode/biometrics
- Consider dedicated device for large holdings

**App verification:**
- Only download from official sources
- Verify URLs before entering seed phrase anywhere
- Legitimate apps will never ask for seed phrase after initial setup

---

## What You Now Have

After setup, you control:

**Public address:** Share to receive funds

**Private key:** Stored in wallet app, used to sign transactions

**Seed phrase:** Master backup that recreates all keys

**Independence:** No company needed to access your crypto

This is self-custody. You're now your own bank—with all the power and responsibility that implies.
