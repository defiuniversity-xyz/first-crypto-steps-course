# Lesson 1: What is a Crypto Exchange?

**Core concept:** A cryptocurrency exchange is like a currency exchange at the airport—a place to swap one type of money for another.

## Currency Exchange at the Airport


![Inline Analogy](https://storage.googleapis.com/first-crypto-steps-media/images/lesson_01/first-crypto-steps_01_inline_analogy.png)

You're traveling from the US to Japan. At the airport, you find a currency exchange booth:

- You hand them US dollars
- They give you Japanese yen
- They charge a fee for the service
- They set the exchange rate

Cryptocurrency exchanges work similarly:

- You give them regular money (dollars, euros)
- They give you cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- They charge fees for the service
- They determine exchange rates based on supply and demand

The main difference? Crypto exchanges are digital platforms, not physical booths.

## What Exchanges Actually Do

Exchanges provide several services:

**Buy crypto with regular money:** The primary function for newcomers. Connect your bank or card, purchase cryptocurrency.

**Sell crypto for regular money:** The reverse—convert your crypto back to traditional currency when needed.

**Trade crypto for crypto:** Swap Bitcoin for Ethereum, Ethereum for Solana, etc.

**Hold your crypto:** Exchanges provide wallets to store what you buy (though self-custody is generally recommended for significant amounts).

**Price discovery:** By matching buyers and sellers, exchanges establish what crypto is "worth" at any moment.

## Centralized vs. Decentralized Exchanges

Two types of exchanges exist:

### Centralized Exchanges (CEX)
Companies that operate like traditional brokerages.

**Examples:** Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Gemini

**How they work:**
- Create an account (with identity verification)
- Deposit money
- The exchange matches your orders with other users
- The exchange holds your funds until you withdraw

**Pros:** Easy to use. Fiat on-ramps. Customer support. Familiar interface.

**Cons:** Requires identity verification. The exchange holds your keys. Can freeze accounts.

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)
Smart contracts that enable direct wallet-to-wallet trading.

**Examples:** Uniswap, Jupiter, Raydium

**How they work:**
- Connect your own wallet
- Trade directly from your wallet
- No account creation needed
- You keep custody of your funds

**Pros:** No identity verification. You control your keys. Permissionless.

**Cons:** More complex. Can't buy with regular money directly. No customer support if you make mistakes.

**For beginners:** Start with centralized exchanges. Move to DEXs after you understand wallets and transactions.

## Choosing an Exchange

When selecting a centralized exchange, consider:

**Reputation:** How long have they operated? Any major security incidents? What do users say?

**Jurisdiction:** Are they licensed in your country? Following regulations often means more protections.

**Fees:** What do they charge for buying, selling, withdrawing? Fees vary significantly.

**Ease of use:** Is the interface beginner-friendly? Some exchanges are designed for traders, others for newcomers.

**Available cryptocurrencies:** Do they support what you want to buy?

**Security features:** 2-factor authentication? Withdrawal confirmations? Cold storage for funds?

**Fiat options:** Do they accept your payment method? Bank transfer, credit card, etc.

Popular beginner-friendly options include Coinbase (US), Kraken, and Gemini—but research what's available and well-regarded in your country.

## What Exchanges Are NOT

Common misconceptions:

**Exchanges are not wallets:** While they provide wallet-like functionality, leaving crypto on an exchange means trusting them with your keys.

**Exchanges are not the blockchain:** The exchange is an intermediary. Your crypto only truly moves to your control when withdrawn to your own wallet.

**Exchanges are not regulated like banks:** In most countries, crypto exchange deposits aren't insured like bank deposits. If the exchange fails, you might not get funds back.

**All exchanges are not equal:** Security, reliability, and customer service vary dramatically. Do your research.
