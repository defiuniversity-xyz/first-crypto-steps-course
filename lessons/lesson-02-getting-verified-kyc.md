# Getting Verified (KYC)

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/first-crypto-steps-media/images/lesson_02/first-crypto-steps_02_header.png)


**Core concept:** Most exchanges require identity verification (KYC) to comply with laws—similar to showing ID when opening a bank account.

---

## Showing ID to Open a Bank Account

Remember opening your first bank account? You probably needed:
- Government-issued ID
- Proof of address (utility bill, lease)
- Social Security number
- Maybe a parent's signature if you were young

The bank verified who you were before letting you use their services. This wasn't curiosity—it was legal requirement.

Cryptocurrency exchanges face similar requirements. "KYC" (Know Your Customer) and "AML" (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations require them to verify user identities.

## What You'll Typically Need

Centralized exchange verification usually requires:

**Level 1 (Basic):**
- Email address
- Phone number
- Basic personal info (name, birthday)

This might let you: Browse prices, set up account

**Level 2 (Standard):**
- Government ID (passport, driver's license)
- Selfie or photo holding ID
- Proof of address (sometimes)

This lets you: Buy/sell up to moderate limits

**Level 3 (Enhanced):**
- Additional documentation
- Source of funds verification
- Higher limits approval

This lets you: Higher transaction limits, full access

Different exchanges have different requirements and limits at each level.

## Why KYC Exists

Reasons (good and controversial):

**Legal compliance:** Governments require financial services to verify customers. Exchanges that don't comply face shutdown.

**Prevent financial crimes:** Money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion—KYC helps track these.

**Tax reporting:** Exchanges often report transaction data to tax authorities.

**Fraud prevention:** Verified identities help if someone tries to fraudulently access your account.

**Controversial aspects:**
- Privacy concerns—exchanges have your personal data
- Excludes people without standard documentation
- Data breaches can expose personal information
- Some see it as contradicting crypto's permissionless nature

It's a trade-off: regulated exchanges offer easier fiat access and legal protections, but require giving up anonymity.

## What to Expect During Verification

Typical process:

**Step 1: Create Account**
Email, password, maybe phone verification.

**Step 2: Start Verification**
Navigate to "verify" or "get verified" section.

**Step 3: Personal Information**
Enter name, address, date of birth, SSN or equivalent.

**Step 4: Document Upload**
Photo of government ID. Both sides. Clear and readable.

**Step 5: Selfie/Liveness Check**
Take a photo or video of yourself. Sometimes holding your ID. Sometimes following prompts (turn head, blink).

**Step 6: Wait**
Verification can take minutes to days depending on exchange volume and your information.

**Step 7: Confirmation**
You'll be notified when verified (or if additional documents needed).

## Tips for Smooth Verification

**Use clear photos:** Good lighting, no blur, all text readable.

**Match information exactly:** Name should match ID exactly, including middle names if on ID.

**Updated documents:** Expired IDs are rejected.

**Recent address proof:** Utility bills or bank statements usually need to be recent (within 90 days).

**Be patient:** High-demand periods mean longer verification times.

**Contact support if stuck:** Most exchanges have help for verification issues.

## Verification Alternatives

If you want to avoid full KYC:

**Decentralized exchanges:** DEXs don't require identity verification since you're just connecting your wallet. But you can't buy with fiat directly.

**Peer-to-peer platforms:** Some platforms connect buyers and sellers directly with varying verification requirements.

**Lower limits:** Some exchanges offer limited functionality with basic verification.

**Bitcoin ATMs:** Some have lower verification requirements for small amounts (but often higher fees).

Each alternative has trade-offs in convenience, security, or availability.
